Following benchmarks were already present (in original or modified form) and have been omitted: 
<ul>
  <li>blur.scm</li>
  <li>church.sch</li>
  <li>church_backup.sch</li>
  <li>sat.scm</li>
  <li>toplas98/matrix.scm</li>
</ul> 
Some benchmarks with identical names were kept since the file contents were
sufficiently different. Where needed, benchmarks were modified to make them work (e.g., some benchmarks
did not use valid Scheme syntax such as square brackets or had missing parentheses).
